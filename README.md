ansible-ffmpeg-build
====================

### 2014-09-18:

I've updated this playbook to work with the current version of ansible, but I don't expect to maintain it further. I've started using Docker for the system this was being applied to so anything that needs to change will happen in that configuration.

[Dockerfile](https://github.com/ozzyjohnson/docker-ffmpeg-webm)

[Automated Build](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/ozzyjohnson/ffmpeg-webm/)

A simple playbook to clone and build ffmpeg + some useful codecs from source. 

I put this together for building/updating the master template for a set of virtual machines which generate VP8 files from RTP streams generated by Cisco IP cameras for easy viewing in a web browser.

Based on the [Ubuntu Compilation Guide](https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/CompilationGuide/Ubuntu).
